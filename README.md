# PyServ

A small web server that I use to host my personal website.

## Installation

* Make a user `py`.
* Give them access to a PostgreSQL database (e.g. `py_databrowse`).
* Give them rights to access and execute, but not write(!) to this directory and its subdirectories.
* Copy pyserv/config.py.example to pyserv/config.py and tweak until it's correct.
* Execute `./run.sh`.
